# PathFinder
Personal Project

Developed a shortest path finding visualizer in Java, using Java Swing and Java AWT technologies, to find the shortest path between two user defined points on a 2D grid. The program creates a new window and draws a 2D grid  for users to interact with.
Implemented Djikstraâ€™s algorithm as the path finding algorithm that supports additional functionalities such as path recovery and obstacle maneuvering. 

-- !PathFinder(bfs).jar --
 - Bread First Search algorithm implementation to find shortest path
 - Controls:
        Left Click & S_key = Place start block
        Left Click & E_key = Place End Block
        Right Click & Drag = Draw obstacles to be evaded my search algorithm (Must be placed before start and end blocks)
