# PathFinder

Developed a shortest path finding visualizer in Java, using Java Swing and Java AWT technologies, to find the shortest path between two user defined points on a 2D grid. The program creates a new window and draws a 2D grid  for users to interact with.
Implemented Djikstraâ€™s algorithm as the path finding algorithm that supports additional functionalities such as path recovery and obstacle maneuvering.
